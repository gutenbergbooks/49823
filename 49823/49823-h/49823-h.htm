<h2><a name="preface" id="preface"></a>THE PREFACE</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="dropcap">O</span>NE of the hopeful observations during the few
years of applied art education in our schools has
been the readiness with which educators have taken
up and kept problems in which the mediums of expression
were practical and efficient, suitable for the
purpose intended, and the equal readiness with which
they have dropped other problems.</p>

<p>The burning of wood as a means of decoration did
not stand this test, therefore it had to go. Oil paint
is not a suitable medium to decorate textiles, therefore
it too has nearly fallen from use.</p>

<p>The value of applied art to home and community
rests upon the test, whether the pupil who works out
the problems becomes by virtue thereof a more useful
and cultured individual in the home and in the social
and industrial life of the community.</p>

<p>A problem which satisfies this test becomes a basic
problem. To a pupil who has once bound a book
with its cover design, end papers, etc., a book is a
different thing ever after. He becomes a more intelligent
and cultured member of the consuming
public so far as books are concerned. To the demands
of many such members the book binders
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>5]</a></span>
respond with better things. Therefore book binding is
a basic problem.</p>

<p>Similar reasoning applies when a student weaves
a fabric, plans and makes an article of dress, a toy,
a silver ring, or a poster.</p>

<p>No one will dispute that the all-over dyeing of a
fabric, and the decoration of a textile with a dyed
pattern, are basic problems. The recent war brought
home the vital place that dyes hold in the life of the
people.</p>

<p>As suitable materials have become available
teachers have been eager to learn and use these
problems.</p>

<p>It is seldom that an applied problem comes to the
art teacher that offers in so full a measure the essential
features of a basic problem as does batik work,
which involves both all-over and pattern dyeing.</p>

<p>The mechanical process is rather simple and offers
no especial difficulty, requiring only the painstaking
care that good teachers exact from pupils.</p>

<p>The design element involved may be simple or
elaborate, fitted to the capacity of the pupil. It is a
real problem in design, however, allowing great freedom
yet carrying with it the discipline of a later test,
viz., applied expression within the limitations of definite
mediums.</p>

<p>As the process controls the entire surface, the pupil
is directed to plan his design and ground areas both
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>6]</a></span>
in space and color relations. The mediums used are
fabrics and dyes, both inseparably involved in education
as they are in life. The pupil must plan for the
use intended and also for the particular type of individual
or scheme of decoration.</p>

<p>The work carries with it all along the anticipation
of results; and the beautiful finished piece is the reward
of effort. What more could be desired in an
applied school problem?</p>

<p>The endeavor and the hope in presenting this little
book on &ldquo;Batik and Other Pattern Dyeing&rdquo; is to help
those who are learning to undertake these problems
with breadth of thought and efficiency of method.</p>

HISTORY AND CHARACTER OF BATIKS</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>EXTILE art is one of the
oldest arts known to man.
Personal adornment was perhaps
the first attempt at
expressing beauty. Costume
designing and textile industries
are still most vital
movements in the artistic
development of the people.</p>

<p>Asia is the great mother of
beauty in textile decoration.
We do not talk or write about
textiles without using the
words of her ancient peoples.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Batik&rdquo;&mdash;this ancient Asiatic word&mdash;is one of the
oldest crafts of the Orient. In India, Java and Japan
the highest technique is reached. These people have
made a great art of costuming. Each caste, religion
and festival requires its special garment.</p>

<p>From the historic days when Columbus searched
vainly for a shorter way to the fabled riches of the
East Indies until the way was found, these treasure
islands held the possessions most coveted by the
Western World.</p>

<p>More than a thousand years before this time, the
neighboring Hindus came to these rich islands bringing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>12]</a></span>
with them religious teachers, road makers and
skilled craftsmen. Many expeditions fastened upon
the native tribes the religion and culture of the older
and more civilized country.</p>

<p>While the Spanish, Portuguese and English adventurers
were discovering new lands and claiming them
for their kings, the Dutch sailors carried to and fro
the produce of the world. The Netherland warehouses
were filled with treasures of the Orient.</p>

<p>Keeping pace with its industry were the universities
and the common schools. The records and drawings
of Dutch scholars disclose so much detailed information
upon the handicraft industries of the day
that the recent revival of batik is traced to their
genius.</p>

<p>Books issued by the Dutch Government to promote
the batik craft, picture Javanese women and girls
seated upon fiber mats before a vertical frame upon
which the material is hung for the execution of their
art. Men too are at work printing and dyeing these
fabrics. Housewives in staid processionals display
the occupation. Princes and fine ladies disport their
gorgeous costumes. Priests climbing the steps of
their temples past the long rows of their sacred gods
are resplendent in batik array. Their oldest gods are
clothed in sculptured batik.</p>

<p>Designs of great beauty and skilled execution enrich
the pages of these rare volumes.</p>

<p>Among the Dutch people much effort has been
made to promote this art. Native designs have been
fostered and the modifications have been in demand
for European trade.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>14]</a></span>
The American adaptation of batik has followed
closely upon the European revival.</p>

<p>The Chinese, however, have control of the industry
in Java. They employ natives at low wage to make
batiks. The home occupation that took no account
of time or pains is dying out. In a few years the
products of this infinitely better craft will be found
only in museums and in the possession of collectors.
Under Chinese management batik making has become
the leading occupation.</p>

<p>Batik is a method of drawing or painting with wax
upon a fabric, after which the material is dyed and
the wax removed. The result of this process is a
decoration in silhouette upon the dyed background
of the goods.</p>

<p>The wax generally used in Java is hot beeswax or
a vegetable wax imported from Japan. The wax is
removed by scraping and melting. The waxing is
repeated as many times as there are colors in the design.
The process is long and tedious and often requires
months.</p>

<p>Formerly the colors were native vegetable dyes.
The most common were indigo, mango tree bark and
madder. These colors have fallen into disuse, artificial
dyes having replaced them.</p>

<p>The wax resists the action of the dye-bath except
where it cracks. Here the dye creeps in, producing
the characteristic &ldquo;crackle&rdquo; of batik work. The
Oriental craftsman never forces crackle. With him
it is always an incident, the subtle accident of his
handicraft.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 433px;">

<p class="caption">JAVANESE WOMAN ENGAGED IN BATIK DECORATION</p>
</div>

<p>The nature of the process forces simple execution
in waxing the shapes and outlines, and also limits the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15"><!-- original location of illustration --></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>16]</a></span>
number of times the piece may be dyed. Applying
the wax becomes increasingly difficult after each dipping.
Spotting of color over the entire piece makes
thinking in color as important as the painting in of
the wax.</p>

<p>The Oriental process of dyeing is the reverse of the
American, in that it applies the darkest colors first.
This necessitates previous waxing over parts to be
kept light and also the removal of the wax and an
entire new waxing after each dyeing. The American
method is to dye the lightest colors first and build up
the deeper colors. Between dyeings the old waxing
is repaired and additional areas waxed.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;sarong,&rdquo; worn by Javanese natives, is a skirt-like
piece of goods about the size and proportion of
a window curtain. This garment falls from the
waist, or above it, to the feet. The fabric is cheap
cotton manufactured in Holland or England. The
color and decoration of the sarong is influenced by
caste and religion. The feudal framework of Javanese
society has given much significance to rank.</p>

<p>The women add to the sarong a &ldquo;kemban.&rdquo; This
garment is not unlike a blouse without shoulder supports
or sleeves. The kemban is wound tightly about
the body under the arms. The drapery covers the
upper part of the sarong.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;slendang&rdquo; completes the wearing apparel of
the women. It is a scarf worn for adornment or useful
for carrying the youngest child, or other burdens.</p>

<p>The Javanese man wears the sarong in the same
manner as the women, which leads the foreigner to
awkward misunderstandings. His long hair is done
on the top of his head and bound around with a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17"><!-- original location of illustration --></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>18]</a></span>
&ldquo;sarong kapala.&rdquo; This head dress is tied at the nape
of the neck. The sarong kapala is square, and when
fitted is starched and shaped to the head.</p>

</div>

<p>Among the poorer classes these garments are plain,
usually dark blue, for daily wear, but on occasions
they are vivid with color decorations.</p>

<p>The native worker prepares his cotton goods by
soaking in oil, afterwards in lye. This process is repeated
until the material is softened and a pleasing
yellow gray.</p>

<p>Hand decoration is done by women. The material
is hung over an upright frame. The hand supports
the goods, and the molten wax is applied to the design.
They use a funnel-like cup with a bamboo
handle. The wax trickles slowly through the slender
tube, and with this the outline is made. This instrument
is called a &ldquo;tjanting.&rdquo; There is no right or
wrong side of this fabric, as the waxing is done on
both sides. To cover large surfaces with wax, they
use a brush. These women have acquired a high degree
of skill through repetition of the same design
on the same kind of garment.</p>

<p>The wooden frame over which the goods are fastened
is moveable. The wax is melted over an
earthen heater with an open side, into which the ends
of long sticks are thrust for burning.</p>

<p>Although the tjanting is the more desired and
versatile device for applying wax, the men wax batiks
with &ldquo;tjaps.&rdquo; The tjap is a wooden block with designs
of metal insert. The craftsman sits on a low
stool in front of an inclined table over which the
goods are smoothly spread. The bottom of a shallow
pan is covered with wax, heated in the same manner

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>20]</a></span>
as for the tjanting. An absorbent pad is placed in
the pan, the tjap is pressed on the pad and imprinted
on the fabric. The fabric is then turned and, with
another tjap made like the first except with its symmetry
reversed, wax imprints are made in exactly
the same places. This insures good waxing on both
sides of the fabric. The piece is then ready for the
dye.</p>

<p>Sometimes a set of many tjaps is used to work out
a pattern for a sarong or other garment. The making
of these tjaps is the laborious and expensive work of
experts. Of course we may expect to find many
repetitions of such patterns, differing from one another
only in the accidents of dyeing.</p>

<p>Frequently different methods of applying wax are
used in the same decoration. Freehand work with
the tjanting and brush on fine pieces serve to take
away from the mechanical reproduction of tjap designs.

study.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>21]</a></span>
The most artistic and highly regarded effects in
batiks among the Japanese workers are executed as
they are in America today, <i>i.e.</i>, the wax is applied
with a brush and is as free from mechanical aids as
painting.</p>

<p>Pieter Mijer, in &ldquo;Batiks and How to Make Them,&rdquo;
published by Dodd Mead &amp; Company, New York,
writes of the modern development of batiks in Holland.
The artists who have stimulated the present
interest are Cris Lebeau, Dijesselhof and Lion
Cachet. The illustrations of their work have a charm
and individuality worthy of the highest respect. The
author&rsquo;s own piece shown in the same group does not
lose by comparison.</p>

<p>This book is also rich in valuable instruction and
other illustrations of batiks, showing high American
standards of the craft.</p>

<p>Batik adaptation in America is without tradition,
and is an outgrowth of youth and enthusiasm caught
up and carried on the high tide of progress and opportunity.
The real significance of its popularity
reaches backward into the necessity that confronted
workers in textile designing after Europe was caught
in the maelstrom of war.</p>

<p>The textile manufacturer has quickly adapted batik
designs, indeed the artist working in batiks feels a
close kinship to textile industry.</p>

<p>Batik decoration is free from limitations that restrict
mechanical printing. In designing fabrics for
the ordinary methods of mechanical reproduction,
where great yardage is produced, the designer consults
an average taste; whereas in batiks each piece is
definitely designed with a particular setting or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>22]</a></span>
individual in view. There is no necessity for much
repetition of any design, nor indeed can exact copy
ever be made.</p>

<p>The first enthusiasm of the worker in batiks is apt
to find expression in a burst of color run riot, of
&ldquo;crackle craze,&rdquo; with too little attention paid to design.
But this soon gives way, as it should, to more
conservative expression in which design is the controlling
element, and the art comes to its own as a
method of subtle and beautiful illumination of
textiles.</p>

PRINCIPLES OF DYEING FABRICS</h2>
</div>


<h3>ALL-OVER DYEING</h3>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE simplest process of
dyeing a fabric consists
in submerging it in a solution
of dye, known as a &ldquo;dye-bath,&rdquo;
and allowing it to extract or
exhaust the color from the
bath. It is necessary that
there be an attraction or affinity
between the fiber of the
fabric and the dye in solution.
All parts of the fabric must be
given equal opportunity to extract
the dye in order that a
uniform color or &ldquo;level&rdquo; dyeing
be obtained.</p>

<div class="figcenternocap" style="width: 159px;">
<a name="p035" id="p035"></a>
<img src="images/bopd25.jpg" width="159" height="249"
alt="Using a dye-bath" />
</div>

<p>To accomplish this end experience has found that
a few simple things must be observed. These have
to do with, (1) the preparation of the fabric for dyeing,
(2) the making of the dye-bath, (3) the handling
of the fabric while in the dye-bath, and (4) the
handling of the fabric after the dyeing.</p>

<p>1. <em>The Preparation of the Fabric.</em> The fabric
must be clean. A spot of grease or other soil allows
that part of the fabric less opportunity to extract
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>36]</a></span>
color from the dye-bath, with the result that the dyeing
is not level. Thorough washing with soap and
warm water followed by a good rinsing will remove
most spots. The methods of the dry cleaner will be
necessary for others.</p>

<p>All sizing must be removed. Sizing consists of
substances such as clay, flour, starch, gum, oil, tallow,
soap, etc., put into the fiber, either before or after
weaving, for the purpose of giving weight, body,
strength, stiffness, softness, finish, or other desired
quality. Some sizing prevents the extraction of color
from the dye-bath. In other cases the sizing itself
absorbs a large share of the color, and later when the
sizing is removed by washing this color goes with it.
Vigorous washing with soap and hot water, followed
by rinsing, will remove most sizing. A fabric which
suffers injury by the removal of its sizing is not suitable
for dyeing.</p>

<p>Previously dyed fabrics are often uneven in color
due to spotting and fading. Level dyeing cannot be
done over such color. The practice of the professional
dyer is to remove or level this color before attempting
further dyeing. This often calls for skill
beyond that of the inexperienced worker. Sometimes
prolonged boiling in strong soap suds will accomplish
this. Many colors will also yield to hot
hydrosulphite solution followed by a good rinsing.</p>

<p>Of course where goods have been previously
colored there are limitations as to the colors that may
be obtained by additional dyeing. For example, blue
goods cannot, without the removal of the blue color,
be dyed yellow but may be dyed green or purple or
a deeper blue. Yellow goods cannot be dyed pink,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>37]</a></span>
but may be dyed orange, green, brown or black. This
will be discussed more fully later.</p>

<p>Some fibers are hard and harsh and resistant, like
crash and most new cotton cloth. This is due to the
presence of gums, resins, waxes and other impurities,
substances which either attract dyes or else prevent
their taking the fiber. It is not possible to dye such
goods successfully without first rendering the fibers
soft and absorbent. This may be accomplished by
prolonged boiling in washing soda. Repeated washing
and exposure to air will also do it, hence old
cotton usually dyes well. Technically there are elaborate
and carefully carried out chemical processes of
preparing cotton cloth for dyeing, and entire mills
are busy doing this one thing.</p>

<p>The Javanese and other Oriental peoples purchase
cotton cloth from Europe and treat it for many days,
alternately soaking in oil and boiling in lye from
ashes, then exposing to the hot sun. This process is
repeated until the cloth is soft and absorbent and suitable
to receive color decoration.</p>

<p>The cloth should always be thoroughly wet before
putting it into the dye-bath. This should be done in
water of the same temperature as the dye-bath.</p>

<p>It may be briefly mentioned here that a fabric must
sometimes be given a treatment with some chemical,
called a mordant, before it will exhaust certain dyes
from the bath and be properly dyed.</p>

<p>2. <em>The Making of the Dye-Bath.</em> For simple
dyeing, as mentioned at the beginning of this chapter,
we must observe the following things:</p>

<p>The dye-bath must be sufficient in quantity to cover
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>38]</a></span>
the goods well and to permit of their being worked
thoroughly during the process of dyeing.</p>

<p>For the &ldquo;dye-vat,&rdquo; or container for the dye-bath,
use preferably a large graniteware pan or stone jar.
Metal dishes, especially iron, are sometimes injurious.
Professional dyers often use vats of copper,
brass or wood.</p>

<p>Soft water is preferable, and it should be free of
sediment. The presence of iron in water is most injurious
as it dulls, or &ldquo;saddens,&rdquo; the shade of most
colors. A hard water containing lime should be purified
or softened. Lime sometimes causes uneven
dyeing.</p>

<p>The dye must be completely dissolved in the water.
If specks of undissolved dye are present there will
be a spotted uneven dyeing. It is best to dissolve the
dye in a small amount of water in a separate dish and
then strain it. This should be added to the dye-bath
a portion at a time during the dyeing. The reason
for this will appear later.</p>

<p>The temperature of the dye-bath has much to do
with the dyeing. There is no general rule applicable
to all dyes. Each dye is usually accompanied by
directions as to the temperature to be used. In general
it may be said that all dyes work better in warm
or hot solution. Some dyes require prolonged boiling;
in other cases boiling is positively injurious to
the dye. Sometimes a definite temperature below
the boiling point must be maintained. Sometimes
the temperature is raised or lowered during the dyeing.
In all cases the temperature should be kept the
same in the different parts of the bath, otherwise the
dyeing will be uneven.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>39]</a></span>
Many dyes, while most successful at high temperature,
work very well in moderately warm, or even
cold solution. This is of very great advantage in
pattern dyeing, as in batik work, where the wax forbids
a high temperature.</p>

<p>The composition of the dye-bath is not often as
simple as we have indicated. Usually the dyer adds
one or more other chemicals to assist in dissolving the
dye, to control the rate of absorption of the dye by
the fabric, or for some other purpose.</p>

<p>Some of the finest dyeing is done in baths so complex
and with operations so exacting in care that only
the trained professional with his elaborate equipment
is able to undertake it.</p>

<p>3. <em>The Handling of the Fabric in the Dye-Bath.</em>
Since all parts of the fabric must have equal opportunity
to be dyed, in order that a level dyeing be
obtained, it is absolutely necessary that the goods be
worked as long as they remain in the dye-bath. This
working must be thorough and continuous without
interruption. This cannot be emphasized too much.</p>

<p>Let us think what happens if this rule is not heeded
and the goods stand a few minutes in the bath. Some
parts of the fabric will lie inside the folds of other
parts and, having access to only a small part of the
dye-bath, will soon exhaust all of the dye available,
a condition known as &ldquo;local exhaustion.&rdquo; Meanwhile
other parts of the fabric more favorably situated
will continue to absorb dye. More uneven dyeing
in schools and homes is due perhaps to this cause
than to any other.</p>

<p>Constant working of the goods keeps the dye that
yet remains in solution uniformly distributed in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>40]</a></span>
bath so that all parts of the fabric are absorbing dye
alike. It also maintains what is equally essential to
level dyeing, a uniform temperature in all parts of
the bath.</p>

<p>It is to minimize the danger of uneven dyeing due
to this local exhaustion that the dye-bath must be
made of sufficient volume to cover the goods well.
The goods must be moved about in the bath with the
greatest freedom.</p>

<p>It is for the same reason, especially when the affinity
between fiber and color is very great, that the
dye is added a small portion at a time. The goods
after being treated with part of the dye are lifted out
of the bath, a new portion of dye quickly added and
stirred, and the dyeing operation renewed. This is
repeated until the desired shade is obtained.</p>

<p>The beginner is apt to think that to get a full color
requires a concentrated dye-bath. Experience will
teach him that, when the dyes are properly chosen
for his fabric, a full color is obtained better by a
longer treatment in a dilute bath, with additions of
dye as mentioned above. In this way nearly if not
all of the color put into the bath is absorbed by the
cloth. This serves for economy of color, makes observation
and control of the process easier, simplifies
the problem of rinsing, and improves the quality of
the dyeing. It is the only way dyeing to shade can
be accomplished.</p>

<p>A slow dyeing is generally more level and successful
in every way. In cases where the fiber absorbs
the color greedily the dyer sometimes puts other ingredients
called &ldquo;assistants&rdquo; into the bath to retard
this absorption.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>41]</a></span>
Frequently the craftsman does shaded dyeing, such
as a scarf with deep blue ends grading to a light blue
center. The following directions will accomplish
this: Hold the scarf in the middle with one hand,
dip the ends into the dye-bath and work them thoroughly
with the other hand. Then lower the scarf
into the bath very gradually without interrupting the
working. If a half hour is taken to lower the scarf
the ends will be in the bath perhaps thirty-five minutes,
the center five minutes, and besides, before the
center is dyed most of the color will have been exhausted
from the bath.</p>

<p>4. <em>The Handling of the Fabric After the Dyeing.</em>
The usual procedure after dyeing is a thorough
rinsing to remove all surplus dye and chemicals. The
importance of this will be appreciated from the following
considerations:</p>

<p>If not removed many chemicals which have been
used as assistants, becoming more concentrated as the
goods dry, act injuriously on the dye or the fiber.
Likewise any unused color will continue to dye the
goods and of course unevenly. It is clearly essential
that the rinsing be done immediately upon removal
of the goods from the bath. The directions sometimes
call for washing in soap and water after dyeing.</p>

<p>The excess of rinse water should be removed and
the goods dried as rapidly as possible. Usually there
is no objection to wringing. A fabric should never
be allowed to hang and drain dry, as the dyeing is
liable to become uneven in streaks, especially when
the dye used is one given to run or &ldquo;bleed,&rdquo; or in any
case where the rinsing has not been absolutely
thorough. The craftsman in dyeing a small piece
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>42]</a></span>
frequently puts it between towels or newspapers to
absorb the excess water and then shakes it until dry.
This is to be commended. The technical dyer has
suitable machinery to accomplish this work.</p>

<p>To dry a batik piece, where the wax forbids wringing
or rough handling in any way, spread the piece
carefully on towels or newspapers, cover with more
towels or papers to remove the excess water, then
shake very gently until dry, or hang on a waxed line.</p>

<p>At no time during the process of dyeing should
the goods be allowed to remain in contact with other
absorbent surfaces, such as boards, paper, cloth,
clothes-line, grass, etc. These are apt to absorb color
away from the goods and leave faded streaks or spots.
A clothes-line used for this purpose should be waxed
to make it non-absorbent.</p>


<h3>PATTERN DYEING</h3>

<p>The preceding general principles have been outlined
with all-over dyeing especially in mind. We
now come to the consideration of pattern dyeing,
where in order to produce a design it is necessary to
dye chosen parts of the fabric and keep the dye away
from other parts. All that has been said with reference
to making all-over dyeing efficient applies
equally well to pattern dyeing. If possible, everything
that is done to make all-over dyeing successful
should be done in pattern dyeing to obtain a corresponding
success.</p>

<p>Practically, however, we find it impossible to carry
out some of the steps. For example, in the usual
block printing, we do not have the problem of handling
the fabric in a dye-bath, but rather that of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>43]</a></span>
handling dye on the fabric. Here we must take special
steps to get the dye well into the fiber and secure
the results obtained from the large dye-bath in all-over
dyeing.</p>

<p>The fabric must be prepared for pattern dyeing in
the same manner as for all-over dyeing. It is just
as essential that it be clean, free of sizing, with its
fibers soft and absorbent. Attention has been called
to the pains taken by the Orientals in the preparation
of their fabrics for decoration. We must not jeopardize
our success by omitting to boil out new raw
material and to clean old material.</p>

<p>This washing before dyeing also brings about any
shrinkage that is to occur, and of course this must be
done before the design is traced on the cloth, otherwise
one could not intelligently work to dimensions.</p>

<p>A dyed pattern may be produced in several ways:</p>

<p>1. The dye is applied to the desired parts of the
fabric and means taken to set it there without it
spreading to other parts. This is known as direct
coloring. Block printing and stenciling, as ordinarily
done, are examples. Calico printing is an
industrial application of the method.</p>

<p>2. A resist of some kind is applied to parts of the
fabric to prevent their taking the dye, after which
the fabric is treated in a dye-bath. Batik decoration
and tie-dyed work both fall in this class. Stencils
and print blocks may also be used in the application
of the resist.</p>

<p>3. A &ldquo;discharge&rdquo; is put on parts of previously
dyed goods, which either removes the color where it
touches, or else alters the shade. Different discharges
are used according to the nature of the dye and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>44]</a></span>
goods. Some chemicals used as discharges are liable,
unless skillfully handled, to attack and tender the
cloth. The method belongs rather to the industrial
world where abundant apparatus and trained dyeing
chemists are available. It is not, however, beyond
the skill of a good craftsman who has acquired some
experience with dyes.</p>

<p>The dye for direct coloring is applied in liquid
form, sometimes thickened into a paste by use of
gums, starch, etc. Often mordants or other assisting
chemicals are incorporated into the mixture. In
block printing this color mixture is brushed on the
block, which is then imprinted on the fabric in the
desired place, and the color driven into the fiber
with pressure or a sharp blow. Stenciling is done by
brushing the color mixture through the open parts of
the stencil, or by blown stenciling in which a volatile
color mixture is sprayed with an atomizer.</p>

<p>The best method of setting the dyes in this direct
coloring is that pursued commercially in calico printing,
treatment with dry steam, <i>i.e.</i>, steam applied
at a temperature sufficiently high to prevent its condensation
into drops of hot water on the fabric, which
would be quite ruinous to the design. This is done
successfully by Oriental craftsmen, and it would be
very desirable to have suitable apparatus in American
schools and studios.</p>

<p>Next best, though considerably less efficient, is
the commonly practiced method of laying the fabric
between dampened cloths and pressing with a hot
iron until dry.</p>

<p>The resist method has an advantage in that it
allows the use of a dye-bath. The limitation of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>45]</a></span>
temperatures that may be used places some restriction
on the choice of dyes. Batik dyeing must be
done without melting the wax resist. But after
eliminating those dyes which require high temperatures
and also those not suitable for pattern dyeing,
there still remains a good range of colors. Batik
is without doubt the most versatile of all methods
of pattern dyeing.</p>

<p>Tie-dyed work depends upon tightly wound string
or yarn to resist the dye. It also has the advantage
of the dye-bath. Though less versatile than batik,
it has a time-honored place as a method of beautiful
and charming results. The introduction of sticks over
which the tying is done, such sticks as are used by
the children in stick printing, has opened new problems
with added variety and much interest.</p>


<h3>DYES</h3>

<p>The colors available for craft work are commonly
grouped into the following classes, which will be
briefly described:</p>

<p><em>Direct Colors.</em> These are so called because they
are applied to all fibers directly without the use of
mordants. They are principally used for dyeing
cotton. Some dyes of this class have affinity for
both cotton and wool. Most of the package dyes
sold at the local stores are of this class. They are
applied to cotton in a boiling bath and to wool at
high temperature near the boiling point. Different
assistants are used varying with the dye and the
nature of the fabric.</p>

<p>The direct colors, being very soluble, are prone
to &ldquo;bleed&rdquo; when the goods are washed, but owing
to this same fact it is easy to produce level dyeing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>46]</a></span>
on the goods. On this same account, however, and
also on account of the high temperature required,
they are not well suited for pattern dyeing.</p>

<p><em>Acid Colors.</em> These have great commercial value
for dyeing wool and sometimes silk. The best of
them are quite fast to light but not to washing. They
are not suitable for cotton or linen.</p>

<p><em>Basic Colors.</em> These will dye wool and silk directly
and also raffia, straw, basketry material, leather
and wood. They dye cotton when mordanted with
tannic acid, and this constitutes a very large commercial
use. Basic dyes are especially strong in
coloring power. Many of them are fugitive to light.
A few of the best of them, however, when properly
applied, are fast to washing and fairly fast to light.</p>

<p><em>Sulphur Colors.</em> These are used extensively on
cotton, giving colors fast to washing and to light.
The dyeing is done at high temperature in a strongly
alkaline bath of sodium sulphide along with other
assistants. The colors are all dull and the range of
colors is not complete, there being a lack of reds.
These dyes are not suitable for silks.</p>

<p><em>Vat Colors</em> are so called because the method of
dyeing is that of the indigo vat. Indigo has been
known for a long time, but only in recent years have
other dyes of this class been produced, until now the
series includes the entire range of colors. As a class
they are the fastest colors ever known. The best
of them are so fast that the cloth will wear out without
the color changing. They are used chiefly on
cotton and linen, sometimes on silk.</p>

<p>Vat dyes have been very expensive and scarcely
obtainable during the war. Their future is of great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>47]</a></span>
interest and importance both in the industries and
to craft workers.</p>

<p>In addition to the dyes above mentioned there are
many others the use of which is quite complicated
and technical and therefore confined to the industries.</p>

<p>For a fuller discussion of dyes and their uses the
reader is referred to Pellew&rsquo;s &ldquo;Dyes and Dyeing&rdquo;
(Robert McBride &amp; Co., New York). This is a
most excellent book written for craftsmen. Like
most of our literature, the treatment of dyes is based
upon pre-war conditions, when nearly all of our
colors were imported. The latest edition, however,
contains an added chapter dealing with the present
transitional state, incident to the transfer of the industry
to this side of the water and the development
of great American color houses.</p>

<p>It may be added that the leading firms carrying
school art supplies offer dyes in suitable form especially
adapted for the problems in pattern dyeing.</p>

<p>Perhaps a few suggestions to the less experienced
of our readers will prove helpful. All of the good
dyes manufactured today are in a very pure form.
The use of one dye alone often gives results that are
crude without any subtle beauty. It is frequently
necessary to apply the principle well known to all
workers in color, that colors are softened and beautified
by small admixtures of their compliments; that
one color that is cold, or another that is hot, becomes
warmed or toned by a suitable admixture of other
colors.</p>

<p>It may be stated that most of the beautiful dyeing
is built up from two or more colors. This is accomplished,
according to the nature of the dyes and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>48]</a></span>
fabric, by mixing the colors in the same dye-bath,
or by dyeing the cloth successively in different colors.
Of course the previous condition of the fabric must
be taken into account. A bleached cotton cloth must
be treated differently from a grayed one if an equally
soft effect is desired.</p>

<p>In the old days dyes contained impurities which
often caused beautiful grayed effects. But it is inexcusable
today for anyone with knowledge of the
above principle and with elementary knowledge of
dyes and dye-baths not to get equally good results.</p>

<p>The inartistic work that we see so prevalent today
in the realm of dyed fabrics is due in part to ignorance
and lack of appreciation of good color and in
part to the commercial race for profit. As the taste
of the people makes demand for better things the
response of industry will not be wanting.</p>

<p>Nor need the craftsman of today spend idle time
mourning the disappearance of vegetable colors and
his necessity for using coal tar dyes. We must remember
that only the best of the vegetable dyeing
has come down to us. The proportion of poor work
with vegetable dyes has always been as large or even
larger than with the present-day colors. We are too
prone to compare the ordinary home dyeing of today
or the cheaper commercial dyeing with the good
pieces that have been preserved from the past. When
in justice the comparison is made of the best with
the best, the coal tar dyes not only do not suffer but
they really gain.</p>

<p>The coal tar dyes are like the vegetable dyes in
the sense of being organic. In many instances they
are identical chemically with corresponding dyes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>49]</a></span>
formerly obtained from vegetables. The one difference,
as we have indicated, is their purity. Just
as our granules of sugar have displaced the sweetening
of former days; just as our modern medicines
have succeeded the herb-teas of our grandparents,
so also have come our dyes. All are achievements
of science.</p>

<p>Coal tar dyes have come to stay, vegetable dyes for
the most part have gone and will not return, and
there is no sadness in the word. It is rather for us
to rise to the challenge that has come, to recognize
our greater heritage, and by pains, patience and
intelligence in our work to ply the art worthily.</p>


<h3>COLOR MIXING</h3>

<p>The following general principles of color mixing
apply to dyeing, both when colors are mixed in a
dye-bath and when they are dyed one color over
another:</p>

<p>Red is grayed by small amounts of yellow and
blue or by any color containing both of these, as
green, brown or gray.</p>

<p>Yellow is grayed by small amounts of red and
blue or by any color containing both of these, as
purple, brown or gray.</p>

<p>Blue is grayed by small amounts of red and yellow,
or by any color containing both of these, as
orange, brown or gray.</p>

<p>Red plus yellow gives orange or yellowish red or
reddish yellow. These are grayed by a small amount
of blue or any color containing blue, as green, purple,
brown or gray.</p>

<p>Red plus blue gives purple or reddish blue or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>50]</a></span>
bluish red. These are grayed by a small amount of
yellow or any color containing yellow, as orange,
green, brown or gray.</p>

<p>Blue plus yellow gives green or bluish yellow
(usually called greenish yellow) or yellowish blue
(usually called greenish blue). These are grayed
by a small amount of red or any color containing
red, as orange, purple, brown or gray.</p>

<p>Red plus yellow plus blue give&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) One of the above if any one or two of the
three is present in the small proportion necessary
for graying purposes.</p>

<p>(2) Gray if all three are present in such proportion
as to neutralize each other. If this is perfectly
accomplished we have a neutral gray, otherwise
a red gray, yellow gray, blue gray, purple gray,
etc. Gray intensified becomes black, and there are
modified blacks, as blue black, green black, etc. In
making up a gray or black, beginners usually err in
taking too large a proportion of yellow, and perhaps
also of red.</p>

<p>(3) Brown if the three are present within certain
other ranges of proportion. Browns may be classified
as yellow browns, red browns, blue browns,
green browns, purple browns, etc.</p>

<p>There are all gradations between neutral gray and
the browns; between the browns and the secondary
colors, orange, green and purple; between the secondary
colors and the primary colors, red, yellow
and blue.</p>

<p>In the practical handling of dyes, in order to get
the entire range of colors from the primary colors,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>51]</a></span>
it is necessary that the red, yellow and blue dyes
chosen be pure and luminous in color quality. Fortunately,
there are such dyes.</p>

<p>There are, however, other valuable dyes that do
not have this purity of color. For example, there
are yellows containing considerable red or brown,
reds containing yellow or blue, blues containing red,
etc. Then there are dyes that are green, brown,
purple and black. All of these have limitations
when used in compounding colors. Neither a yellow
inclined to the brown, nor a red containing blue,
can be used to form a luminous orange. Likewise
the compounding of a vivid blue green, or reseda
green, forbids either the yellow or the blue containing
any appreciable admixture of red.</p>

<p>All of these dyes find great use in the industries,
and all of them, within their limitations, are valuable
for color mixing. Having acquired a working
knowledge of red, yellow and blue dyes, it will be
found of practical benefit to include some of the
others. An experienced craftsman works with a
small range of colors chosen for his particular
purpose.</p>

<p>Dyes differ in coloring power, even different specimens
of the same dye, so that it is not possible to
give quantitative formulas for certain colors bearing
popular names. It will be helpful to discuss a few
of them.</p>

<p>Olive green may be made by adding to blue-green
either red or preferably yellow brown. This addition
should be made a little at a time with frequent
tests, a suggestion applicable to all color mixing.</p>

<p>Tan is obtained by mixing yellow and yellow
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>52]</a></span>
brown. An added tinge of blue or green gives
pongee.</p>

<p>Gold contains much yellow with certain smaller
amounts of red and blue. But it might be difficult
to control the addition of these colors, so it is better
to start with much yellow and add a little at a time
orange and blue green.</p>

<p>For burnt orange add yellow brown to orange.</p>

<p>For turquoise add to blue a little yellow, or preferably
blue green.</p>

<p>For old rose add to dilute red a tinge of blue or
preferably purple.</p>

<p>Taupe is a gray thrown off, usually with purple,
but sometimes with red or yellow or blue.</p>

<p>Salmon is formed by adding to yellow some orange
and a tinge of brown.</p>

<p>Any dyeing over old color must be considered as
a mixing of the new color with the old, which manner
of thinking will help in choosing the dye necessary
for a desired effect. For example, a green
cloth is to be dyed black. There should be two
dyeings, the first a red to neutralize the green, the
second a black to intensify the neutrality. Likewise
a red cloth becomes black by dyeing first green and
then black.</p>

<p>Over a light yellow purple may be dyed, the result
will be a grayed purple. Over a strong yellow much
purple will be required and the result will be a very
much grayed purple approaching if not becoming
a purple black.</p>

<p>In batik decoration by successive dyeings the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>53]</a></span>
craftsman is constantly mixing the new dye with that
already in the fiber. Having once introduced an
intensity of any primary color, yellow, red or blue,
he must thereafter, unless he removes this color, complete
his pattern by producing secondary and tertiary
colors.</p>

WAX RESIST PROCESSES</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE most commonly used
fabrics for batiks are thin
silks, white or light in color.
Wax penetrates the sheer materials
better. They take the
color more evenly, and retain
their brilliant texture. Heavy
materials must be waxed on
both sides to insure perfect
stopping out of color.</p>

<div class="figcenternocap" style="width: 161px;">

alt="Painting a design" />
</div>

<p>The design is more easily
applied to thin goods, as the
decoration is readily traced.
On heavy fabrics the design
is either drawn free hand or pounced. When the
outline is drawn in wax the drawing does not disappear
in the dyeing. When only parts of the design
are painted in with wax the outline must be redrawn
after each dyeing. For this purpose pouncing is
best.</p>

<p>Velvets should be stopped out on the wrong side.
Steaming will raise the pile again, or it may be sent
to the dry cleaner.</p>

<p>Wood is a good medium to take wax resist. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55"><!-- original location of illustration --></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>56]</a></span>
wax is removed by scraping. The surface is cleaned
with gasoline and finished in any approved manner.
Toys, frames, trays, basket bottoms, boxes, etc., are
very pleasing when decorated in this manner.</p>

<p>Leather and paper are dampened and pasted
smoothly on glass. They are then decorated like
wood.</p>

<p>Chiffons and crepes may be waxed double, or even
folded four times.</p>

<p class="caption">THE COMPLETED PATTERN</p>
</div>

<p>In applying a design, care should be taken to keep
the fabric straight. Drawing a thread from the fabric
makes a good guide.</p>

<p>When working upon woven materials it is best to
use a frame placed horizontally upon a table. A
frame suitable for this work should be light to handle
and strong. It should be high enough above the
table to keep the wax or dye from touching it. When
the wax touches an obstacle before it is cold it sticks.
The wax is apt to break when pulled away from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>58]</a></span>
object. Color penetrates by accident and the result
is disappointing. Some artists work on a table upon
which smooth or glazed paper is spread. Here again
the wax may also suffer. When dyes are painted on
the fabric, if they touch the table or other objects
they spread and mar the definite outline of the design.</p>

<p>A frame, around the inside edge of which are
cloth strips for pinning or sewing the fabric securely,
is an excellent aid to good workmanship. Adjustable
holes with corners secured by screws and wing nuts
make it possible to roll long pieces of cloth at the
top and bottom of the frame. Or by means of these
holes the strips may be spliced together to form a
still larger frame.</p>

<p>Paper should be rolled with the cloth to prevent
the wax sticking. Handled in this manner only a
small part of the work needs to be exposed, and the
work can be done on a small table or school desk.</p>

<p>Another advantage of such a frame is the ease with
which the piece is laid aside without injury during
the intervals of work. This is especially valuable
where class problems are being conducted. It also
permits of the work being done in any position&mdash;horizontal,
inclined or upright.</p>

<p>When dyeing the material more than once the wax
must be carefully mended after each dyeing, or soon
the first spaces covered with the resist are lost or
badly obscured. The material should always be
dry before applying the wax.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 408px;">

<p class="caption">COLORS PAINTED WITHOUT WAX OUTLINES</p>
</div>

<p>Some workers use pure beeswax. It does not break
easily when worked in a warm dye-bath. It melts
at a high temperature. Resin mixed with beeswax
melts at a still higher temperature. There are special
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59"><!-- original location of illustration --></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>60]</a></span>
batik waxes that have all the desired qualities of
toughness and resistance. These mixed waxes are
similar to those used by industrial works in Java.
Paraffin and beeswax are also used.</p>

<p>The best container for molten wax is a double
boiler, the common kitchen utensil, as it is possible
to keep the wax hot through a class period without
having the heater in the class room. As means of
heating, an electric toaster, gas plate, canned heat,
etc., are suggested.</p>

<p>The wax must be applied hot. The brush, while
waxing, should be kept hot to insure good penetration
of the wax. To accomplish this, each time the brush
is dipped into the molten wax it should be held there
sufficiently long to remelt any wax that may have congealed
in or on the brush.</p>

<p>To apply the wax, some use a tjanting. Others prefer
the simpler method of a good sable or camel&rsquo;s
hair brush. The brush gives a broader and more
varied treatment. A broad brush is best for covering
large surfaces. Brushes used for painting in oils or
water colors are used for painting in wax and dyes.</p>

<p>Those who are interested further in the possibilities
of the tjanting are referred to Pieter Mijer&rsquo;s excellent
treatment of this subject.</p>

<p>Dyes suitable for pattern dyeing should not run or
&ldquo;bleed.&rdquo; Some use only primary colors. Others desire
a more extended range. A good selection may
include red, yellow, blue, orange, green, purple,
brown and black.</p>

alt="A floral design" />
<p class="caption">PART OF A DESIGN STOPPED OUT WITH WAX, READY FOR THE FIRST DYEING</p>
</div>

<p>The temperature of the dyes should be below the
melting point of the wax. Care must also be used in
dissolving dye. Granules in the dye-bath work havoc
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61"><!-- original location of illustration --></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>62]</a></span>
with an otherwise beautiful piece of dyeing. The dye
should be filtered through a closely woven cloth.
Prepared dyes insure safety, as the compounding and
dissolving is done by formula.</p>

<p>After the last dyeing the fabric should be rinsed
first in warm, then in cold water. Much of the wax
is removed in the rinsing. The remainder of the
wax is easily removed by ironing between layers of
newspaper, followed if necessary by a bath of gasoline.
If the piece is very large it should be finished
by a professional cleaner.</p>

<p>There are different approved methods of pattern
dyeing with wax resist, in the choice of which the
craftsman must consider the conditions under which
the work is to be done. We give in outline the steps
of three methods:</p>

<p>I. Painting the decoration within waxed outlines,
followed by one or more baths for the ground
color. This is illustrated on pages <a href="#p055b">55</a>, <a href="#p056">56</a> and <a href="#p057">57</a>,
where the following steps were taken:</p>

<p>1. A square of white china silk, clean and free of
sizing, was stretched on a frame.</p>

<p>2. The main lines were sketched in with charcoal.
The design was outlined in wax. The shapes
were made small, as dye is liable to streak when
painted over large areas.</p>

<p>3. The colors were mixed and used like water
colors.</p>

<p>4. The small bell-shaped flowers were painted
red, the pods yellow, the leaves green. These painted
surfaces were then stopped out with wax.</p>

<p>5. Two gallons of warm water were softened and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63"><!-- original location of illustration --></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>64]</a></span>
made into a soap suds. This solution was divided
into two equal parts. The first part was used for
wetting the fabric, and &ldquo;soaping off&rdquo; after dyeing.
The second part was made into a brown dye-bath for
the dipping.</p>

alt="The same floral design as the last image" />
<p class="caption">THE COMPLETED PATTERN</p>
</div>

<p>II. Painting directly on the fabric without waxed
outlines, and building up the ground color in one or
more baths. The piece illustrated on page <a href="#p059">59</a> was
done as follows:</p>

<p>1. The design was drawn free hand upon the
fabric, stretched in a frame.</p>

<p>2. The colors were painted directly. The tree
was green, the bell-like flowers orange, the dogs
golden yellow. The brush strokes were very small.</p>

<p>3. The colored shapes were carefully covered
with wax.</p>

<p>4. The background was dyed a deep purple.</p>

<p>III. Building up the pattern by dyeing in successive
baths, beginning with the lighter and passing
to darker values, and before each dipping stopping
out with wax the parts to be retained in the completed
work. The piece illustrated on pages <a href="#p061">61</a> and
<a href="#p063">63</a> was executed as follows:</p>

<p>1. The design was drawn on strong paper. This
was then perforated, and the design pounced on the
silk with powdered charcoal, using a stiff bristle
brush and scrubbing the charcoal well through the
holes.</p>

<p>2. The parts to remain white were stopped out by
painting with wax.</p>

<p>3. The piece was dyed yellow, after which the
design was again pounced.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>65]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>66]</a></span>
4. The parts to remain yellow were stopped out
with wax.</p>

<p>5. The piece was dyed black.</p>

<p>In all these processes a small piece of the goods
was carried completely through the dye-bath to
test the color.</p>

<p>Some modifications of these processes are valuable.
These follow, or are suggested by, practices of the
Orient.</p>

<p>1. The design may be applied with blown stenciling.</p>

<p>2. Block printing and stick printing may be used
and the color impressions covered with wax.</p>

<p>As concrete illustrations of textile decoration in
schools we present some of the results of two class
problems in high school, the one by a first and second
year class, the other by third and fourth year pupils
with a few who were posting.</p>

<p><em>First and Second Year Class.</em> The pupils used
the method of paper cutting to secure motives for
their designs. Each pupil was supplied with enough
white silk to make a collar, or a tie, also with color,
wax and a frame upon which to stretch the silk. The
method was that of outlining in wax, painting in
color, and dipping for the ground color. The pupils
were allowed to keep their work after paying for the
materials. The illustrations on page <a href="#p065">65</a> were chosen
from the finished pieces.</p>

<p>The crepe-de-chene collar is 12 x 12 inches. The
outside border and the largest shape at the point of
the collar were old rose, the fan-like shape turquoise
blue, the band and spottings at the side yellow. The

inside border, buds and stem were blue and the alternating
shapes yellow.</p>

<p>These colors were covered with wax and the collar
dyed gray. It was then dipped in hot wax, carefully
crackled and dipped in a dark gray bath. The wax
was removed by ironing between layers of newspaper.
Fine embroidery silk was dyed yellow and
old rose for the stitchery that finished the edge of
the collar.</p>

<p>The sailor collar was made of white china silk.
The leaves of the design were painted green, the
flowers rose color and the ground dyed a dark gray
blue. The dye-bath was made of blue, black and
purple. The collar was finished with yellow and old
rose stitchery.</p>

<p>The pongee silk vest was designed for a tailored
coat. The leaves and flowers were painted realistically.
The ground was dyed blue and crackled in a
darker blue bath. The edge was finished with dark
red stitchery.</p>

<p><em>Third and Fourth Year Class.</em> This work was
conducted at a later time. In addition to more training,
these pupils had for study many specimens of
good batiks and standard illustrations of the same.
The designs were made with reference to their fitness
as batik designs.</p>

<p>The design units illustrated on page <a href="#p073">73</a> were
selected with reference to their adaptability to some
form of all-over application.</p>

<p>The design for the book cover, also shown as an
all-over pattern, page <a href="#p070">70</a>, the all-over pattern, page
<a href="#p067">67</a>, and the scarf, page <a href="#p069">69</a>, were selected as the best
work of this class.</p>

A tracing of the all-over design, page <a href="#p067">67</a>, was first
made and painted in water colors. The design was
transferred to the silk by tracing. The colors of the
decoration, following the copy in water color, were
painted in without the use of wax outlines. The top
units from left to right were blue, violet, yellow;
second row, violet, blue, green, violet; third row,
yellow, violet, blue; fourth row, violet, blue, green,
violet. The stems were violet, the leaves yellow
green. The background was dyed a rich brown.</p>

<p>The all-over design, page <a href="#p069">69</a>, was used for the end
of a scarf. The silk was dyed yellow, parts of the
decoration stopped out with wax, the flowers and
body of the insect painted in red, the red stopped
out with wax, and the background dyed brown. The
scarf was finished with a fringe of orange silk.</p>

<p>The all-over design, page <a href="#p070">70</a>, was pounced on the
silk after each dipping. The material was dyed
yellow and the small spottings stopped out. The
piece was dipped in a gray purple dye-bath. The
resultant color was a grayed lavender. The larger
shapes in the design were stopped out and the ground
color dyed a deeper purple.</p>

<p>Two other examples of batiks from this class are
illustrated:</p>

<p>1. The china silk blouse, page <a href="#p071">71</a>, with a yellow
background and all-over pattern of white, blue and
green shows a design that is suitable for yardage.</p>

<p>2. An all-over design, page <a href="#p071">71</a>, also suitable for
yardage. The lavender flowers and leaves were
painted inside waxed outlines. The spots were connected
by flowing waxed outlines. The decoration

was covered with wax and the ground color dyed a
pale yellow gray.</p>

<p>The china silk handkerchief, page <a href="#p074">74</a>, is very interesting.
The size is 17 x 17 inches with a one-inch
hem. The area inside the hem was covered with
wax, placed in a bath of cold water, and carefully
crackled. It was then immersed in a blue dye-bath.
After drying the same area was rewaxed, again
crackled, and immersed in a red dye-bath. The result
is very pleasing, a purple border with blue, red and
purple crackle forming a delicate net work over the
white center.</p>

BATIKS AND OTHER ILLUMINATED

<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>PPLIED design has
been the stabilizing
factor in art education. It
gives to art education a tangible
reason for its place in
the schools. It injects into
every individual and class
project the element of discipline
that comes through
being required to think in
terms of definite mediums
of expression.</p>

<p>The greatest emphasis,
and for this reason perhaps
the greatest success, has been its application in the
field of costume designing and interior decoration.
Batiks lay a just claim to having enriched this phase
of art expression. A new creative and illuminating
touch has been given to draperies, covers, cushions,
scarfs, wall hangings, and costumes.</p>

<p>The following pages illustrate and explain a number
of these illuminated objects.</p>

</div>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>77]</a></span></p>

<h3>SARONGS</h3>

<p>The sarong decorated with peacocks and vines is
characteristic. The colors are red, blue and light
yellow.</p>


<h3>END PAPERS</h3>

<p>The decoration of the <a href="#endpaper">end papers</a> in this book is
taken from the design of a very fine old sarong.
The material is cotton. It has the quality and texture
of the rarest batiks. The dyeing is vegetable
indigo. Some of the units were perhaps applied
with a tjap, but much of the waxing was done with
single and double spouted tjantings. The ground
color is a soft gray yellow.</p>


<h3>SARONG DETAILS</h3>

<p>The batik details shown on page <a href="#p095">95</a> are all taken
from old sarongs. The tjanting was used for all
these patterns. They are excellent pieces of native
craftsmanship.</p>

<p>The pattern on the left has a yellow gray background.
The all-over dyeing is brown and the spottings
dark red.</p>

<p>On the right the upper pattern has yellow gray in
the background and brown decoration, the lower
pattern has brown background and yellow gray
decoration.</p>


<h3>COSTUME JEWELRY</h3>

<p>The band for this ornament, page <a href="#p078">78</a>, is made of
several layers of georgette crepe picoted. It is &frac34;
inch wide and 1 yard long. The ornament, 1&frac12; x
2<sup>3</sup>/<sub>8</sub> inches, was modeled from &ldquo;petroplast,&rdquo; the modeling
clay which sets without firing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>78]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>79]</a></span>
The silk was folded to four thicknesses. The wax
was painted in a variety of interesting shapes on the
white goods. Bands in red, yellow, green and orange
were painted with dyes.</p>

<p>The petroplast was modeled smooth and the bird,
flowers and pedestal were incised while the composition
was still plastic. When dry it was dipped in
black enamel. The outline of the bird was enameled
in yellow and orange, the flowers painted in purple
and blue, the pedestal in brown.</p>

<p>This adornment was planned to be worn as a necklace
to brighten a dark costume.</p>


<h3>COSTUME DECORATION</h3>

<p>The costume decoration, page <a href="#p053">53</a>, was batiked on
yellow taffeta silk.</p>

<p>The design was painted in with wax. The piece
outside the decoration was covered with wax. The
material was dipped in a dark brown bath and finished
by ironing between layers of newspapers.</p>

<p>It is suitable for a vest or for millinery.</p>


<h3>BLOUSES</h3>

<p>1. The blouse, page <a href="#p084">84</a>, with a rose design was
made of white crepe-de-chene.</p>

<p>The outline of the decoration was waxed, and the
roses and leaves painted conventionally. The borders
and spaces were painted in wax. The border
of the red was painted between waxed outlines.</p>

<p>The fabric was dyed blue, and finished with petroplast
beads enameled in red.</p>

2. The detail of a georgette crepe blouse, page
<a href="#p087">87</a>, with a dark background and all-over decoration
in gold, is a suitable design for yardage. The piece
was first dyed gold, and the pattern stopped out with
wax. The dye-bath for the ground color was purple
black.</p>

<p>3. The pongee silk blouse, page <a href="#p080">80</a>, is a good
standard for service and artistic merit.</p>

<p>The leaves, stems and lower border decoration
were painted in wax on the natural color of the cloth.</p>

<p>The piece was dyed blue, then the flowers and
upper border were stopped out. A brown bath followed,
giving as the final color a dark bronze. The
blouse was belted with a bronze silk cord.</p>

<p>4. The crepe-de-chene blouse, page <a href="#p082">82</a>, has a
rich green background with an after crackle in an
orange bath.</p>

<p>The edges, sleeves and neck are decorated with a
narrow orange and gray band.</p>

<p>Petroplast beads decorated to harmonize with the
color of the silk, a brown cord girdle weighted with
these ornaments, picoted edges, and stitchery of silk
floss the same color as the cord finish a garment of
great beauty and dignity.</p>


<h3>SILK LINING</h3>

<p>The crepe-de-chene lining illustrated on page <a href="#p085">85</a>
has a grayed yellow-green background. The flower
motif has yellow, black and orange in the center, red
and purple in the outer parts. The bud is red and
purple. The stem and leaves are blue. These colors
were painted within wax outlines.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>82]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>83]</a></span>
There were eight yards of this lining. When rolling
the waxed goods on the frame, a paper was rolled
up with the material to prevent the wax from
sticking.</p>

<p>The lining was used for a full length blue serge
cape. After two dry cleanings, this garment was
still fresh and beautiful.</p>


<h3>CAMISOLE</h3>

<p>1. The camisole, page <a href="#p078">78</a>, was made from a
14 x 36-inch piece of white crepe-de-chene. Half-inch
purple ribbon, seven-eighths yard long, made
the shoulder straps; a narrow purple ribbon gathered
the top.</p>

<p>2. The design in yellow, brown and green was
painted within wax outlines. The dyeing was in
purple, the crackle penetrating the design.</p>

<p>3. The top was finished with double hemstitching.</p>


<h3>BATIKED RIBBON</h3>

<p>The ribbon illustrated, page <a href="#p078">78</a>, was turquoise
blue satin, 7&frac12; x 36 inches.</p>

<p>The design was outlined and parts stopped out.
The material was dyed in a blue dye-bath. The
blue was stopped out in the flower shapes. The material
was dyed in a yellow dye-bath. The leaves were
stopped out. The material was dyed in a red dye-bath.</p>

<p>The decoration of the finished ribbon was turquoise
blue, gray-blue and yellow-green. The background
was dark olive green.</p>

<h3>INTERIOR DECORATION</h3>


<h3>DOOR CURTAIN</h3>

<p>The door curtain illustration, page <a href="#p075">75</a>, is a symbolic
composition with a mystic wall and gate, and
imaginary birds and a tree.</p>

<p>The color scheme is a black background, blue and
purple tree, yellow and blue birds, a purple and
orange fence and gate, and a foreground of blue, yellow
and green.</p>

<p>The design was painted directly upon a good
quality of silk, without guiding lines or waxed outlines.
The painting was done very rapidly, perhaps
in ten minutes.</p>

<p>The material was dipped several times, once in
yellow, twice in red (more red was added to the dye-bath
after the first red was exhausted), twice in the
blue which was developed the same as the red, and
at last back into the yellow. When the dyeing was
completed the piece was thoroughly rinsed and the
wax was removed.</p>

<p>The crackle caused through successive dyeings,
the soft edges of the outlines and the blending of the
background with the shapes freed the piece from the
criticism often invited where colors are painted in
large areas.</p>


<h3>TABLE COVER</h3>

<p>This design, page <a href="#p089">89</a>, (21 x 25 inches) consists of
two conventional dogs adapted from the Chinese.
The well-chosen colors are yellow and orange, with
accents of black. The border decoration was painted
in light green. Large and small spots suggest the
use of the tjanting. The darkest values are reseda
green.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>87]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>88]</a></span>
The fabric was first dyed yellow. The dogs and
spacing of borders were drawn in fine wax outlines.
The dogs were painted orange, with small shapes of
black for accents, and covered with wax. The material
was then dipped in green dye, rinsed and dried.</p>

<p>The decoration for the border was drawn in wax,
and the background for the dogs was also waxed.</p>

<p>In developing a pattern where so much drawing
is needed, pains should be taken to retain the original
outlines of the drawing. If the design is too much
obscured after successive dippings, the drawing
should again be transferred. The outline for the
dogs and spacings for borders were saved by waxing.
The green decoration on the border was not painted
until after two dippings.</p>

<p>The crackle, tying the whole decoration, is even
and adds beauty to the design.</p>

<p>The beauty of this batik lies in its fitness, its variety
of line, its pleasing space relations and its good color
scheme.</p>


<h3>ELEPHANT DECORATION</h3>

<p>The elephant decoration illustrated on page <a href="#p091">91</a>
(27 x 25 inches) was done on white taffeta. The
frame was made of two-inch basswood with a narrow
gilt-edge moulding for a finish. The decoration
on the frame was batiked.</p>

<p>The elephant, with its decoration and border, was
outlined in wax.</p>

<p class="caption">BATIKED TABLE COVER</p>
</div>

<p>The vertical stripes numbered from left to right
were: yellow (1-3-5-7-9); orange (2-6-10); magenta
(4-8). These were painted in and covered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89"><!-- original location of illustration --></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>90]</a></span>
with wax. The fabric was dipped in a dye-bath of
grayed purple.</p>

<p>The design on the frame was painted in wax and
the colors in the design reproduced from the colors
in the silk. Most of the wax was removed with a
knife and the balance with a gasoline wash. It was
afterwards finished with a coating of wax.</p>

<p>This wall hanging has a few spots where the treatment
was not thorough. The red stripe under the
elephant&rsquo;s head shows unintentional breaking in the
wax. Too much blue crept into many places. It
cannot be emphasized too many times&mdash;before painting
over the colors with wax, the colors must be dry.</p>

<p>This work illustrates the success of painting in
rather large surfaces of color without streaks appearing
and harmonizing the whole by tying together
with crackle. The design of the elephant and the outside
border are unusually meritorious.</p>


<h3>&ldquo;A TABLE BEFORE ME&rdquo;</h3>

<p>This decoration was drawn on glazed paper and
pounced on white china silk, 40 x 72 inches. There
was no painting of colors, the process being one of
dippings only.</p>

<p>The design was outlined in wax. The small spottings,
border lines and markings in the vine were
stopped out, and the piece was dipped in a yellow
dye-bath.</p>

<p>Through each dipping a dye record was kept by
carrying a small piece of the goods through the dye-bath.
After each dyeing the wax was carefully
mended.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>92]</a></span>
The bell-like flowers in bands or borders, the flowers
at the foot of the vine, the body, wing, tail and
lower part of the bird&rsquo;s legs, tendrils, dragon fly and
border were stopped out, and the piece dyed orange.</p>

<p>The remaining bands and shapes in the flowers,
inside and outside border, and tendrils were stopped
out and the next dipping was blue. The background
and remaining shapes were a lovely warm gray
lavender.</p>

<p>Part of the leaves, head of the bird, upper part of
the bird&rsquo;s legs, shapes in the foreground, and roots
of the vine were stopped out. The next dyeing was
blue.</p>

<p>The vine, remaining leaves, tendrils, the remainder
of the foreground and spaces that were needed to fill
in were drawn in wax.</p>

<p>The wax was removed from the wing and the tail
of the bird and the batik dipped in a dye-bath of
deep blue.</p>

<p>The color range in this piece includes red-orange,
yellow, blue, turquoise, two shades of lavender, green
and sparkles of white broken by every color, on a
gray-blue background.</p>

<p>The work on this batik extended over a period of
two weeks.</p>


<h3>&ldquo;THE CAPTURE&rdquo;</h3>

<p>The <a href="#p010">frontispiece</a> is worthy of special study.</p>

<p>The material was white pussy willow silk, 40 x 72
inches.</p>

<p>A sketch of the design, 6&frac12; x 10 inches, was made
in water colors.</p>

The fabric was freed from sizing and dyed a pale
yellow.</p>

<p>It was then stretched in a frame and the three
&ldquo;thunder birds,&rdquo; the clouds, and a few flowers in the
foreground were painted in wax. The bills, eyes and
legs of the birds were painted in with orange dye.</p>

<p>The roadway, parts of the rocks, drapery on the
Indian maiden, some of her decoration, and parts of
the foliage, were painted directly on the silk with
yellow or orange dye.</p>

<p>The remaining foliage, more decoration worn by
the maiden, the grass, leaves on the flowers and the
stems were painted green.</p>

<p>These shapes were stopped out with wax. Much
painting in of shapes was done with wax. This gave
a finish and jewel-like quality to the work as it progressed.</p>

<p>Before the material was dyed it was soaked in
warm water the same temperature as the dye-bath.
The piece was then dyed in a bath of blue. It was
worked constantly for about ten minutes. It was
removed from the dye and rinsed in clear warm
water.</p>

<p>After rinsing, the material was placed flat between
layers of bath towels and much of the moisture removed.
The drying was finished by hanging over
a waxed line.</p>

<p>The sky and the blue of the border were next
stopped out, leaving for the next bath the pony, the
remainder of the Indian maiden, the tree trunks and
other shapes in the foreground.</p>

the custom of Javanese workers. While waxing, the
light shone through and every uncovered spot was
easily seen. A medium sized soft brush was used
for stopping out the large spaces.</p>

<p>Great care was taken to drain the excess wax from
the brush. This is more necessary when the work is
erect, as it prevents the wax from running down the
goods.</p>

<p>The third dye-bath was prepared with red and
a little yellow. A piece of the fabric dyed with the
last dipping was dyed in this bath to test the color.
The material when dyed in this bath was a rich,
red-purple.</p>

<p>After partly drying with bath towels the piece was
stretched on the frame to finish drying.</p>

<p>When thoroughly dry the entire surface was waxed
except the mane and tail of the horse, the hair of
the maiden, a few of the jewels, some details in the
foreground, and the ground of the border.</p>

<p>All the broken places in the wax were carefully
mended for the final dipping. The colors for the
bath were dark green and black. The piece was
finished by rinsing in warm water, then in cold, and
finally by a gasoline bath.</p>

<p>The work extended over a period of two weeks.</p>

<p>It is a finished piece, rare and beautiful in its
illumination.</p>

DYEING FOR PLAYS AND PAGEANTS</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE play bases its claim
in the school curriculum
on the very essence of human
nature. The art of being someone
or something else in
thought and action under a
setting of conditions and
through a flow of events is
practiced by all of us. It is
the eternal expression of playful
and imitative childhood,
and, though restraints enter
with maturity, it never leaves
us. Witness the audience we give to the stage.</p>

<p>This has been recognized in the study of the play
in literature and in the production of the school play.
The application of the art training of the school in
giving the play its setting and costumes is of the
greatest value. The life of a school finds expression,
through co-operation of all departments, in its own
community theater.</p>

<p>Dyeing is an important consideration in a dramatic
production. Colorful costumes and properties have
a large part in making a play.</p>

to the right and to the left&mdash;creating atmosphere by
the merest suggestion&mdash;is simple when dyes and dyeing
enter into the plans of the setting. The old heavy
painted scenery is not a part of the new drama.</p>

<p>The ground cloth and colored lights also offer opportunities
for the service of the dyer.</p>

<p>Costumes are more easily created when soft old
materials are dyed, and it requires but little experience
to discover how the beauty and effectiveness of
a play are enhanced thereby.</p>

<p>The proscenium arch takes its place in the illusion,
when the imagination is stimulated by color decoration.</p>

<p>There should be an intimate co-operation between
the community of little theater and craft workers.</p>

<p>The relation of the little theater to those who do
handicraft is stated by Mr. George Somnes, Director
of the Little Theater of Indianapolis, as follows:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Too much stress cannot be laid upon the importance
of all-over dyeing, batiks, and other pattern
dyeing, and their application in the work of the little
theater.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Preeminently the little theater stands for the giving
of the theater back to the artist, be he producer,
musician, scene designer, costume designer, dancer or
author. There is the endeavor to establish each little
theater group as a means of community expression.
The use of color in its relation to the play and lights,
as scenery and in costumes, is so obvious and necessary
that it needs scarcely more than mention. As experimentation
is necessary and desirable, there must be at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101"><!-- original location of illustration --></a></span>

which to experiment and build.</p>

</div>

<p>&ldquo;School plays and pageants could be improved
many hundred percent if the knowledge of color and
its application were made more general. Not only
would children be taught that green and red go together,
but they would be taught just <em>what</em> greens
and reds form the various combinations&mdash;they could
find out under what lights certain colors react best.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give us more artists and craftsmen and we will
have a real theater; give us local artists and craftsmen
and we will have a Community Theater.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the following item from &ldquo;The Workshop,&rdquo; the
magazine issued by the Little Theater Society of
Indiana, the editor writes to the community of the
dyed costumes used in &ldquo;Dierdre of the Sorrows.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Little Theater Society feels it very significant
that they are able to call attention to the use of color
in the present production and to mention that its application
in this play is the work of local artists. The
Waldcraft Studios have generously given time, service
and experience to help make this production complete.
Does not that sound hopeful for our development,
and by example, are there not more people in
other fields who can give their time, knowledge and
experience to the development of something which
when it is completed as an institution will belong to
you?&rdquo;</p>

were especially dyed, (6) another miniature
stage made of wood, shown plain and decorated with

parts from the Little Theater of Indianapolis, for
which special dyeing was done.</p>

<p>The miniature pasteboard stages, page <a href="#p098">98</a>, were
decorated with opaque water colors by school children.
These illustrate the preliminary step in decorating
a stage with dyed textiles. They would reproduce
in batiks.</p>

<p>The first decorated stage is planned to play
&ldquo;Treasure Island.&rdquo; The decoration over the proscenium
arch is &ldquo;The little ship that is headed south-west,&rdquo;
and the border,</p>

this event took place there were seventeen states in
the Union. The Indians called these states the
&ldquo;Seventeen Fires&rdquo; (Council Fires). These &ldquo;fires&rdquo;
were treated symbolically in the border at the top
of the proscenium arch.</p>

<p>The fires, realistic in color, were painted in and
stopped out with wax. The panels were dyed blue.
The spaces back of the fires and the council were
stopped out with wax and the whole dyed a deep
purple. This stage construction is suitable for the
end of a room or hall where there is no balcony or
for out-of-doors.</p>

<p>The curtain, seen through the proscenium arch
and enlarged on page <a href="#p108">108</a>, is an interesting batik
dyed in values of red, blue and purple.</p>

<p>The decoration was painted realistically on the
white silk and covered with wax.</p>

<p>The bottom of the piece for about four or five
inches was kept in the dye-bath until most of the
color was exhausted. A small amount of red was
added to the bath and little by little the material was
immersed in the bath until about two-thirds of the
goods were dyed.</p>

<p>The top of the material was dyed blue in like
manner.</p>

<p>The bottom is a brilliant red, the top a bright blue
and the center different values of purple and pale
lavender.</p>

TIE-DYED WORK</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HIS beautiful and fascinating
art of textile decoration,
applied to draperies
and articles of dress, has been
practiced in many countries
for centuries. Old pieces have
been found in South America,
in Peru and Bolivia. In the
Philippines and in provinces
of India the work may still
be seen, the art having been
handed down from generations
unknown.</p>

<p>The essential process consists in dyeing the cloth
in a dye-bath after having wound parts of it more
or less tightly with string or cord, which serves as
a resist to prevent the color from reaching those
parts of the fabric. The result is a white or, if the
cloth has been previously dyed, a light colored pattern
on a darker background.</p>

<p>The method is capable of more elaborate work.
There may be several dyeings, beginning with lighter
colors and passing to those of darker values, and between
the dyeings additional tying or untying or
both.</p>

<p>For example, a cloth is dyed light gray, then a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110"><!-- original location of illustration --></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>111]</a></span>
pattern tied into it, after which it is put through a light
blue dye-bath. This gives a light gray design upon
a grayed blue background. But suppose now that
a part only of the tying is removed, some additional
tying done in the grayed blue field, and a third dye-bath
used, this time a light red. The background
becomes a grayed purple and in the design are gray,
grayed blue and grayed red.</p>

<p>There may be a great variety of designs, depending
upon the manner of tying the individual unit and
the spacing of these units with relation to each other.</p>

<p>The Oriental work is characterized by very small
individual ties and the arrangement of many of these
into some geometrical or pictorial pattern. The
grouping of these little ties accurately and uniformly
into lines and design clusters challenges wonder and
admiration. But even with the dexterity acquired
by these people the process is slow and laborious.</p>

<p>The illustration (page <a href="#p110">110</a>) shows a piece of tie-dyed
work from India. The material is cotton.
Careful examination shows it to have been done in
the following manner: The cloth, which is very
thin, was folded to form four thicknesses. Then at
each point where a tie was desired the four thicknesses
were pressed or drawn up and wound very
tightly with string, the very tip of the fabric being
left exposed to take the dye like the background.
After dyeing and removing the ties the cloth was
unfolded, showing the four repeats. The upper left
quadrant was uppermost in the tying, and shows the
dark centers very distinctly. Then came in order
the upper right showing small dark centers, the
lower right showing few dark centers, and the lower
left showing none at all.</p>

As with other crafts that have come to us from the
East, we have not chosen to imitate their marvelous
perfections of detail. It has rather been to our liking
to work out space and color adjustments in a
manner more in keeping with our national temperament.
And it is not without its measure of success
in artistic and pleasing results.</p>

<p>The illustration on page <a href="#p112">112</a> is the work of a school
boy. The material was cotton, dyed old rose before
the tying was done. After the tying it was dyed
deep blue. The space relations are very good.</p>

<p>The work upon such a piece should proceed in
the following manner. First the cloth should be
prepared for dyeing in the manner indicated in the
chapter on dyeing. The centers of the ties should
next be located. Sometimes the cloth is merely
gathered at each center and tied, but with larger patterns
it is often folded in some definite way. The
border in this piece was made by gathering across
the entire piece and tying.</p>

<p>If the tying is very tight the outlines will be sharp.
With a little looseness in the ties the color will creep
in, the results of which are often very beautiful. A
tie that is too loose, however, is in danger either of
coming off in the dye-bath, or it may allow the color
to penetrate to the extent of destroying the design.</p>

<p>Too prolonged treatment in the dye-bath, or dyeing
at too high a temperature, may cause too much
penetration of color into the tied spaces.</p>

<p>On page <a href="#p113">113</a> is shown a portion of a silk scarf. In
this case the white cloth was gathered at the respective
centers, without any definite plan of folding,
and tied rather tightly with a few winds of string
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115"><!-- original location of illustration --></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>116]</a></span>
about an inch or more from the center. The piece
was then dyed a soft gray yellow. Then more winding
was done so as to leave only the tips exposed.
The next dye-bath was a soft blue somewhat stronger
than the yellow. The color qualities are beautiful.
The border shows the penetration of the blue color
in a very happy manner.</p>

<p>The border design on page <a href="#p115a">115</a> shows the result of
a definite manner of folding the cloth before tying.</p>

<p>The portion of a scarf illustrated on page <a href="#p115b">115</a> shows
one large pattern beginning at the center of the
scarf. The scarf was gathered or folded from the
center and tied at intervals. The color is delicate
old rose, especially beautiful for evening wear.</p>

<p>Sometimes small objects, such as marbles or glass
beads, are placed at the center of the tied spots and
the cloth tied around them.</p>

<p>A very interesting development of tie-dyed work
and one which greatly increases the variety of designs
is what we may term stick tying, <i>i.e.</i>, tying over
sticks.</p>

<p>The sticks for this purpose are those commonly
used by school children in stick printing. These are
sold by all the leading school art supply houses.
These sticks are treated so they will not absorb color,
which makes them especially suitable for tie-dyed
work. They are of different shapes, squares, circles,
triangles, oblongs, etc. On these shapes the cloth
may be folded in different ways, giving an element
of geometrical symmetry, which, however, is always
softened in the dye-bath as the color makes its little
incursions into the tied spots.</p>

Stick tying is not only a good craft problem but
also splendid for the school room for both boys and
girls.</p>

<p>It is best to lay out the design on the cloth by stick
printing with a very light tint of the color to be used
in the first dyeing, and using, of course, the end of
the stick over which the cloth is to be tied. This
insures a proper direction of the axes of the tied
spots.</p>

<p>On page <a href="#p117a">117</a> are shown a number of tyings over the
different sticks, and also some dyed spots resulting
from tying in several ways. Any school boy can
devise other stick ties, and he will be delighted with
some of the effects produced by his inventions.</p>

<p>We also show (page <a href="#p119a">119</a>) a silk scarf tied over
sticks, with a border at each end, ready for the dye-bath.
On page <a href="#p120">120</a> is this same scarf after dyeing.
The work was carried out in the following manner:
The stick used was a flat oblong one-eighth inch
thick, five-eighths inch wide and one inch long. The
cloth was stick printed with light yellow to locate
the centers for the ties. The end of the stick was
placed at the center, the cloth folded equally on the
two sides, and the tying done as shown on the first
stick (page <a href="#p117a">117</a>).</p>

<p>The entire scarf was dipped in warm water before
dyeing. This conformed to our directions for dyeing
and also caused the ties to tighten. The piece
was first dyed yellow, then without any change in
the tying it was dyed green.</p>

two white bands. Then followed a red dyeing,
another rinsing, the removal of all ties, and a final
dyeing in a very dilute golden yellow.</p>

<p>The result is a ground color of rich, beautiful
brown. In the tied spots are bands of gold, of
orange-red, of yellow-green and of brown, also a
brown center. Along the edges of these bands the
colors have crept in, one here and another there, to
produce a beautiful iridescence. The same colors
are repeated in the borders.</p>

STICK PRINTING, BLOCK PRINTING
AND STENCIL DYEING</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>T has been seen how versatile
the batik method is as a
means of illuminating fabrics,
also how design is the controlling
element in all good batik
work. In both the space and
color relations the batik worker
has control of the entire surface
subject only to the limitations
imposed by the mediums
in which he is working.</p>

</div>

<p>It follows that a knowledge
of the principles of design must
underlie good batik work as
well as a knowledge of dyes.</p>

<p>In taking up the other ways in which school children
are using dyes, it is well to place emphasis upon
the design elements involved. All dyeing as done
by craftsmen and in the schools involves design.
Even all-over dyeing is carried out with the idea of
the dyed piece becoming a part of some larger whole.</p>

<p>The earliest use of dyes in the schools is in stick
printing, and here begin the first lessons in pattern
dyeing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>124]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>125]</a></span>
All shapes used in design resolve themselves into
certain recognized types. These type shapes are
the square, oblong, triangle, circle, ellipse and oval.
There are also standards of color that have become
associated with these types. They are red, yellow,
blue, orange, green and violet. These shapes and
colors are taught universally by teachers who train
children in the elementary concepts of design.</p>

<p>It is the adjustment of these shapes and colors in
space that constitutes design. It is the application
of these shapes and colors to definite materials for
definite uses in the child&rsquo;s life that constitutes applied
design.</p>

<p>When the child prints a square on his paper it is
a real square and good in color. The next one will
be a real duplicate, both in shape and color. The
problem is where to put the duplicate. That is the
essence of design, and both teacher and pupil are
ready to take hold of it. There is time for discussion
and drill. Results must follow. The child begins
to sense and appreciate standards and to love accuracy,
neatness and orderliness. His interest is sustained
and his powers strengthened through satisfactory
accomplishment. He plans, invents, and executes,
acquires independence of thought and expression,
and designs in accordance with his imagination
and experience.</p>

<p>Very early in the child&rsquo;s training, while the stick
printing is unfolding the elements of design to him,
he applies his designs to enrich his construction
work. It is the time for the child to begin through
concrete efforts to get rooted into his thinking that
designs are made to be applied and that everything
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126"><!-- original location of illustration --></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>127]</a></span>
which contributes to his comfort, happiness and well-being
exists because a design has been applied.</p>

<p class="caption">HINDU BLOCK PRINTED DESIGN</p>
</div>

<p>Then is also the time for the child to see some
printed textiles in which the pattern is geometrical
like his stick printing.</p>

<p>After the child has had sufficient experience with
type shapes, he may add block printing. With the
knowledge and experience gained through the use of
sticks, he is enabled to modify the standard shapes.
A wood block veneered with linoleum that can be
easily cut with a sharp knife into any form desired,
and which maintains a rigid printing surface, brings
this craft within his reach.</p>

<p>In beginning the print block work a square or
rectangular surface may be cut into a pleasing group
of standard shapes involving straight lines and then
simple curves. There may follow at later intervals
in the course problems of increasing difficulty consistent
with the ability to think and execute. Continued
observation of commercial prints and, if possible,
of fine handicraft is always in order.</p>

<p>In connection with block printing may well come
an early lesson in setting colors.</p>

<p>In color printing the color should be a part of the
fiber of the goods without the least injury or change
in the texture. Any process which gums the fiber or
destroys the texture is not beautiful in its results, and
does not give true color printing.</p>

<p class="caption">PRINT BLOCKS, PLAIN AND CUT. PRINT SHOWING INFLUENCE OF STICK
PRINTING AND BLOCK PRINTING</p>
</div>

<p>Besides the method elsewhere referred to, the following
will give excellent results in block printing.
A large tin cover into which a thick piece of felt is
fitted serves as a color pad. Pains should be taken
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128"><!-- original location of illustration --></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129"><!-- original location of illustration --></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>130]</a></span>
to have the right quantity of dye well spread on the
pad. Too much color makes the printing less clear.
When a trial on a piece of the goods is right a large
number of imprints can then be made. The secret of
good work is a nice adjustment of the color pad and
then uniformity of pressure on the block, both in
taking color from the pad and in making the imprint.
The printing is done on a flat surface with a
single layer of blotter beneath the textile. Some
fabrics take the imprint better if slightly dampened.</p>

<p>The illustration of block printing is a specimen of
Hindu work.</p>

<p>The sticks will find continued use in printing connecting
spots and for the introduction of additional
color so often needed for enrichment.</p>

<p>The manufactured textile here illustrated was designed
by using stick printing and block printing.</p>

<p>When the attainment reached with sticks and print
blocks is sufficient to call for larger and more varied
design, it is time for the craft to broaden and include
stenciling.</p>

<p>Stenciling is the most exacting master of simplicity.
It teaches one how to sweep away all that is trivial
and unnecessary in design. It shows the value of
broad, flat tones combined with accurate drawing,
and proves conclusively the vital importance of good
composition.</p>

<p>The stenciling process has been described so many
times that directions for the work are not needed.
An elementary lesson in all-over dyeing can very appropriately
be given in connection with advanced
block printing or stenciling. This might well be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131"><!-- original location of illustration --></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>132]</a></span>
the waxing over of the printed or stenciled pattern,
followed by a dipping for the ground color.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 407px;">
<a name="p131" id="p131"></a>
<img src="images/bopd80.jpg" width="407" height="600"
alt="Three floral stencil designs, and one applied bird pattern" />
<p class="caption">STENCIL DESIGNS. APPLIED STENCIL PATTERN</p>
</div>

<p>The example of stenciling illustrated is a table
cover. The material is natural colored linen. The
colors were liquid dyes blown on with an atomizer.
The bodies, heads and legs of the cranes are orange;
the wings and tails blue. The flowers and spots are
purple, the leaves and stems blue.</p>

<p>Spraying liquid dye with an atomizer permits not
only of the usual direct coloring of the design areas,
but also of resist stenciling, in which a light design
is produced on a dark background. A small dark
design on a large light background is stringy and
thin. The light seems to eat into the edge of the
design and minimize its importance. On the other
hand, a small light design on a large dark background
is magnified in importance. While for proper control
in either case we must adjust the space relations
of the design and background areas, yet it is equally
important that one be able to adjust the color relations
of the design and background areas.</p>

<p>The process for &ldquo;resist&rdquo; stenciling is as follows:
The stencil is laid upon the surface to be decorated,
and the open pattern is carefully covered with a thin
layer of library paste or paste made from flour and
salt water. Flour added to a solution of salt in water
is the best preparation we have found. A palette
knife, or a case knife may be used to spread this
paste. The stencil is at once lifted and the color
desired for the background is sprayed in a flat tone
over the entire surface. The paste acts as a resist,
preventing the penetration of the color. The entire
surface is immediately wet with cold water and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133"><!-- original location of illustration --></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>134]</a></span>
resist washed off. The stencil is carefully and
thoroughly cleaned in the same way and then pressed
and dried.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 408px;">
<a name="p133" id="p133"></a>
<img src="images/bopd81.jpg" width="408" height="600"
alt="Four flower and bird patterns" />
<p class="caption">STENCIL DESIGNS</p>
</div>

<p>This is especially suitable for book covers and end
paper designs, or mats, where the pattern does not
partake of the nature of a repeat, as it is better to
remove the resist while wet.</p>

<p>It is interesting to stencil the open pattern in one
or more colors, then apply the resist and give another
color to the background.</p>

<p>Most interesting stenciling has been done with two
or more stencils. To make these, a stencil should
be cut for each color. Use the original design sheet
for one color. Transfer other color areas to new
sheets. Make all sheets, including the tracing paper,
the same size. Before tracing lay sheets and tracing
paper together and punch coinciding holes in the
upper corners. Keep these holes coincident during
the process of tracing. By means of these holes the
respective stencils are easily applied so that the color
scheme is accurately reproduced.</p>

<p>It must not be overlooked by those who are stenciling
that only part of the color applied becomes incorporated
into the fiber of the goods. The other
part is outside the fiber, adherent to the goods. This
adherent color should be removed. It corresponds to
the excess color in dyeing, which we take pains to
remove by rinsing. The very purpose of the steaming,
or other &ldquo;setting&rdquo; process, is to incorporate the
dye into the fiber. This is never perfectly accomplished.
There is always some excess adherent color
to be removed.</p>

<p class="caption">OLD JAPANESE STENCILS</p>
</div>

<p>How often we meet the following experience: A
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135"><!-- original location of illustration --></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>136]</a></span>
craft worker in decorating a fabric applies color until
the eye is pleased, takes little or no pains to incorporate
the color into the fiber, and ignores altogether
the fact that some of the color is only adherent. Later
this adherent color comes off (not out) in the wash.
There is then disappointment and complaint against
methods, colors, etc., when the real fault is one of
workmanship. Adherent color is never dependable.</p>

<p>The Japanese have been the masters of the art of
stenciling. The technique and beauty of their designs
have not been equalled by any other craftsmen.
For centuries these people have been making imprints
on fabrics.</p>

<p>The old stencils are more simple and the paper of
better quality. These old stencils are always darkened
by time.</p>

<p>The stencils shown in the illustration were collected
by Ernest Fenollosa, an authority on Japanese
art.</p>

<p>Little has been written about these stencils but
many museums and school art departments have collections.</p>

<p>In cutting stencils the Japanese use a number of
tools. Some of these tools are of the nature of
punches, being the shape of the cut out place. There
is no drawing on the stencil paper, the workman
looks at the design and cuts the pattern free hand.
The paper, before cutting, is treated with oil and a
kind of lacquer.</p>

<p>The old stencils were strengthened by a net work
of human hair placed between two stencils cut at
the same time. These stencils were then pasted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>137]</a></span>
together with rice paste. This net work of hair serves
as ties in the stencil and permits a larger freedom of
design than is otherwise possible.</p>

<p>The Japanese use two methods for stenciling, the
direct coloring method, in which the dye is brushed
on the material through the stencil, and the resist
method, in which a paste is rubbed through the
stencil on the white goods and the fabric dyed in an
all-over bath. The color is set by steaming and the
paste washed out. This leaves a white pattern on a
colored background.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to
date contact information can be found at the Foundation's web site and
official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
